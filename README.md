## Google Cloud TTS Rails Pro

**Be careful, this is only a concept. The application is under development.**

Extended version [Google-Cloud-TTS-Rails](https://github.com/cmirnow/Google-Cloud-TTS-Rails) (Ruby on Rails 6, Webpacker, Bootstrap 5, Ajax Flash Messages) allows some improvements: upload and store audio files to Amazon S3... and something else. Right now I'm thinking about it. :)
